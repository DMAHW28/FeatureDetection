# 🔍 Feature Matching with LBP & Corner Detection (FAST & Harris)

This project implements **corner detection** (FAST & Harris) and **feature matching using LBP descriptors** in both **Python** and **C++** with OpenCV. It allows for feature extraction, comparison, and visualization of keypoints and matching results.

## 🚀 Features  
- **FAST** & **Harris** corner detection 🔥🏁  
- **LBP (Local Binary Pattern) descriptor matching**  
- **Implementation in Python & C++** 💻🐍  
- **Comparison between custom and OpenCV's built-in implementations**  
- **Image visualization of detected keypoints & matching results**
